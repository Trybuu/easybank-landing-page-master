# Frontend Mentor - Easybank landing page

![Design preview for the Easybank landing page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
###### I've created a landing page website from Frontend Mentor. I used HTML, SCSS, JS.
##### I MADE VIEWS ONLY FOR 375px AND 1440px!!!
###### So there need to add specific styles for mobile devices just to make it good looking on every screen, but I just wanted to focus on this two resolutions.
